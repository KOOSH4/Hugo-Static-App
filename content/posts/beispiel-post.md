## This is my second post using Hugo, Azure Static Web Apps and deployed via Github actions.

GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration, allowing developers to work together on projects from anywhere. GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool that enables continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows directly from your GitHub repository. Hugo is a fast and flexible static site generator written in Go, which can be easily deployed on Azure Static Web Apps, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for hosting static websites.
